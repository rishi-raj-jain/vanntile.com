React attempts to be as unopinionated as possible. This is both it's greatest strength _and_ weakness.

Over the years, I've tried many different ways to style my React apps. Each solution has its pros and cons.
This article will share my journey using CSS with React and how it's evolved to its current state. Then, I'll discuss pros/cons of
different approaches for styling.

## Vanilla CSS

Like most, I started web development with vanilla CSS. All you need is a single HTML and CSS file. Pretty simple.

```html:index.html
<h1 class="header">Welcome</h1>
```

```css:index.css
.header {
  font-size: 32px;
}
```

### Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) has been rapidly growing in popularity. Many people are frustrated with the bloat of CSS frameworks like
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and want an alternative. Tailwind provides an impressive developer experience with a refined API.

With the combination of [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/), you can easily build extensible, well-designed applications.
